# Channels: creating, opening, and displaying flow:

1. **Channels Creating Flow**:

   - When a user signs up and logs in for the first time, the application automatically creates channels (direct message channels) between the new user and all other existing users.
   - This is handled in the `UserHomeProvider` component, which uses the `useQuery` hook to fetch the list of channels for the current user's ID (`userId`).
   - The `listChannels` API is called with the `userId` parameter to retrieve the user's channels.
   - If the list of channels is not empty, the `isVisible` state is set to `true`, indicating that the channels should be displayed.

2. **Channels Opening Flow**:

   - The `ConnectionsList` component is responsible for displaying the list of direct message channels for the current user.
   - It filters the `channels` array to only include direct message channels (where the `members.length` is less than 3).
   - For each direct message channel, it renders a `ListGroup.Item` component, which displays the other user's profile image, name, and username.
   - When a user clicks on a `ListGroup.Item`, the `handleChannelClick` function is called, which updates the `selectedChannel` in the `ChannelContext`.

3. **Channels Displaying Flow**:
   - The `ChannelsList` component is responsible for displaying the list of channels (both direct message and group channels) for the current user.
   - It filters the `channels` array to only include channels where the number of members is greater than 2 (i.e., group channels).
   - For each channel, it renders a `ChannelCard` component, which displays the channel's title and member count.
   - When a user clicks on a `ChannelCard`, the `handleChannelClick` function is called, which updates the `selectedChannel` in the `ChannelContext`.

The `ChannelContext` is a central context that manages the state related to the currently selected channel, the channel messages, the channel members, and the avatar states for the members. It provides functions to set the selected channel, update the channel messages, set the channel members, fetch and manage user avatars, and manage the attachment cache.

The `UserHomeContext` is responsible for managing the visibility of the channels display based on whether the user has any channels. It provides a `toggleVisibility` function to show or hide the channels display.

Overall, the channels creating, opening, and displaying flow is designed to provide a seamless experience for users to access their direct message and group channels, with optimized avatar handling and attachment caching to improve performance and user experience.
