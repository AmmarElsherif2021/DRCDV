### DRCDV Technical Documentation (UNDER DEVELOPMENT!)

#### **1. Introduction**

Welcome to the documentation for **DRCDV**, the **Dynamic and Responsive Chat Application with Data Visualization** project.

- **Purpose**
  This project aims to develop a front-end for a chat application using React, focusing on creating a dynamic, interactive UI that seamlessly integrates with back-end services. The application supports text messages and visualizes various data types (tabular, images, text, etc.) dynamically within the chat interface.
- **Scope**:
  The documentation provided includes a system overview, installation and setup instructions, usage guidelines, API details, code documentation, as well as deployment and testing procedures..

#### **2. System Overview**

- **Project Description**:
  The application primarily offers a list of active users, allowing the initiation of chats with one or more individuals. Users can exchange text messages, images, data visualization files, and code snippets. However, all users must register their credentials to access the chat space and connect with others.
